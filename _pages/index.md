- Some programming styles are **community conventions**.

_This document contains my **personal** preferences only._

_These style guidelines are intended for Bash libraries and applications._  
_This is less relevant for simple shell scripts, although perhaps useful._

# ‚å®Ô∏è Variables

## `MYAPP_PUBLIC_VARIABLE`

Name public global variables in `UPPERCASE`

Prefix your global variable with something to identify to your users that the variable is associated with your script or program, e.g. `MYAPP_CONFIG_FILE`.

This helps to **avoid global naming collisions** with variables in other libraries which your users may be using.

## `_myApp_privateVar`

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è All private variables should be `local` variables inside functions ([see more](#local))

Name local and non-public variables in `camelCase` (_note:_ `snake_case` _is more popular_)

Prefix your private variables with something associated with your script or program, e.g. `_myApp_configFile`.

This helps to **avoid global naming collisions** with variables in other libraries which your users may be using.

> üí° Reminder: variables you assign will be available to the scope of other functions that you call.
>
> This includes `local` variables.

#### Example

```sh
myFunction() {
  local privateValue=42 # <-- locals are in scope for called functions
  anotherFunction
}

anotherFunction() {
  echo "The private value is $privateValue" # <-- 'local' value available
}

myFunction
# => "The private value is 42"
```

## `declare`

Use `declare` to define variables with dynamic names.

#### Declare Dynamic Name Variable

```sh
# This dynamic variable name is set in a variable
variableName=foo

# Declare the variable using its name from a variable
declare "$variableName=42"

echo "$foo"
# => "42"

# This can also be used to modify the value
declare "$variableName=4"

echo "$foo"
# => "4"
```

#### Declare Dynamic Name Array

```sh
# This dynamic variable name is set in a variable
variableName=foo

# 'foo' is undefined and has a zero length
echo "${#foo[@]}"
# => 0

# Declare the variable using its name from a variable
declare -a "$variableName=(hello world)"

# 'foo' is defined as an array with a count of 2
echo "${#foo[@]}"
# => 2

# The first array item is "hello"
echo "${foo[0]}"
# => "hello"
```

#### Modify Dynamic Name Array

```sh
# This can also be used to push new values onto the array
declare -a "$variableName+=(goodnight moon)"

# Print all values of the array
echo "${foo[*]}"
# => "hello world goodnight moon"
```

> üí° **Note:** Using `declare` in a function assigns the variable as a `local`.
>
> Bash 4.2 adds `declare -g` which assigns the variable in the global scope.

## `typeset -n`

Use `typeset -n` to get a reference to a variable by using _the variable name_.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: this is only available in Bash 4.3 and above

#### Example

```sh
hello="World"

# Modify the value of hello using a variable which contains the variable name "hello"
variableName=hello
typeset -n theVariable="$variableName"

echo "$theVariable"
# => "World"

theVariable="change me"

echo "$theVariable"
# => "change me"

echo "$hello"
# => "change me"
```

## `(set -o posix; set)`

This is the correct way to get a definition of a variable:

```sh
foo=5
foo_list=(a b c)

(set -o posix; set) | grep ^foo
# foo=5
# foo_list=([0]="a" [1]="b" [2]="c")
```

> üí° **Tip:** this is a great way to serialize variables including Bash arrays!
>
> The syntax provided by `(set -o posix; set)` can be safely `eval`'d to reload values.
>
> Consider using this for communicating variables across subshell boundaries.

<br>

# üí¨ Strings

## `cmd` or `"value"`

If text represents a "value", use `"double quotes"`

If text represents a command-line argument, use `no quotes`

#### Example

```sh
dogs setName "Rover"

# In the above example:
# - 'setName' represents a command
# - 'Rover' represents a value

# There's no *technical* reason for the above not to be written as:
dogs setName Rover
dogs "setName" Rover
"dogs" "setName" Rover
"dogs" "setName" "Rover"
# ^ These are all technically equivalent
```

## `grep` & `sed` & `awk`

When possible, use built-in Bash string manipulation and pattern matching over `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, et al.
However, keep your code's maintainability in mind and use these tools when it results in simpler code.

### `tl;dr`

- Do not "blindly" reach for familiar tools such as `grep` and `sed` when Bash functionality would work just as well, if not better.

### String Matching

For simple values, prefer Bash string matching over `grep`.

#### String Contains Example

```sh
var="Hello World"

# Goal: Determine if the value contains the text 'World'

# ‚ùå Don't do this
if [ echo "$var" | grep World ]; then # ...

# ‚úÖ Do this
if [[ "$var" = *"World"* ]]; then # ...
```

#### String Matches Pattern Example

```sh
var=""

# Goal: Determine is the value starts with 'Hello'

# ‚ùå Don't do this
if [ echo "$var" | grep ^Hello ]; then # ...

# ‚úÖ Do this
if [[ "$var" =~ ^Hello ]]; then # ...
```

### String Manipulation

Prefer Bash string manipulation over `sed`.

#### String Replacement Example

```sh
var="Hello World"

# Goal: Replace 'Hello' with 'HELLO'

# ‚ùå Don't do this
var="$( echo "$var" | sed 's/Hello/HELLO/' )"

# ‚úÖ Do this
var="${var/Hello/HELLO}"
```

### String Extraction

Prefer Bash string manipulation over `awk` _depending on the need for performance._

#### String Extraction Example

```sh
var="Hello World Goodnight Moon"

# Goal: Get the second space-delimited value

# ‚ùå Don't do this
var="$( echo "$var" | awk '{print $2}' )"

# ‚úÖ Do this
var="${var*# }"
var="${var%% *}"
```

> ‚òùÔ∏è Caveat: whereas `'{print $2}'` is easy to understand, the following is not:
>
> ```sh
> var="${var*# }"
> var="${var%% *}"
> ```
>
> Keep in mind the performance requirements for your program and choose
> what is right for you.

### `${cheat%%\*sheet}`

[Here](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/string-manipulation.html) is a useful reference for Bash string manipulation.

It's really easy once you get the hang it it!

Just remember:

- `#` is the left
- `%` is the right

#### Substring Removal

> It is _very_ common to want to remove a _part_ of a string:

|      | Description                            | e.g. `.foo .foo .foo`       |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `/`  | Remove first match                     | `${x/foo}` ‚û§ `. .foo .foo`  |
| `//` | Remove all matches                     | `${x//foo}` ‚û§ `. . .`       |
| `#`  | Remove shortest match (from the left)  | `${x#*.f}` ‚û§ `oo .foo .foo` |
| `##` | Remove longest match (from the left)   | `${x##*.f}` ‚û§ `oo`          |
| `%`  | Remove shortest match (from the right) | `${x%oo*}` ‚û§ `.foo .foo .f` |
| `%%` | Remove longest match (from the right)  | `${x%%oo*}` ‚û§ `.f`          |

> üí° **Tip:** When using `#` and `%` you'll usually want to accompany it with `*`

#### Substring Replacement

|       | Description                                             | e.g. `.foo .foo .foo`              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `/`   | Replace first match                                     | `${x/foo/bar}` ‚û§ `.bar .foo .fooo` |
| `//`  | Replace all matches                                     | `${x//foo/bar}` ‚û§ `.bar .bar .bar` |
| `/#`  | Replace match if at start of string                     | `${x/#foo/bar}` ‚û§ `.foo .foo .foo` |
| `/%`  | Replace match if at end of string                       | `${x/%foo/bar}` ‚û§ `.foo .foo .bar` |
| `:`   | Substring to right of provided index                    | `${x:3}` ‚û§ `o .foo .foo`           |
| `: :` | Substring to right of provided index of provided length | `${x:3:5}` ‚û§ `o .fo`               |

> üí° **Related:** To get the length of a string: `${#varname}`

### `shopt -s extglob`

Sometimes you need some more modern expressions in your replacements.

[Here](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/bash-extended-globbing) is a good reference of what `extglob` provides:

> |                  | Description from the bash man page                     |
> | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
> | ?(pattern-list)  | Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns   |
> | \*(pattern-list) | Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns |
> | +(pattern-list)  | Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns  |
> | @(pattern-list)  | Matches one of the given patterns                      |
> | !(pattern-list)  | Matches anything except one of the given patterns      |

The most common need for `extglob` is to match a series of repeating characters

- e.g. `+([\d])` for multiple digits

You have to enable `extglob` to use the extended pattern matching: `shopt -s extglob`

> üí° **Tip:** If you want to be _kind_ and disable `extglob` after using it (_unless it was already enabled_):
>
> ```sh
> # Check if extglob is enabled
> if shopt -q extglob
> then
>   # it was already enabled, go ahead and do your pattern matches
> else
>   shopt -s extglob # turn it on
>   # go ahead and do your pattern matches
>   shopt -u extglob # turn it back off
> fi
> ```

# üóÉÔ∏è Arrays

## `declare -a`

The Bash array is the most powerful tool in anyone's Bash arsenal.

It's a very simple single-dimensional array of text values.

Because Bash `3.2.57` doesn't support Associative Arrays (see [Mac Support](#-mac-support)),
this is the primary data structure upon which all Bash libraries and applications are built!

> üíï Learn to love the single-dimensional Bash array

To declare a new array, use `declare -a` ([see example](#declare-dynamic-name-array) above)

> üí° **Reminder:** `declare -a` assigns the array as a `local` variable in functions.

For recommendations on storing complex data, see [Representing Objects](#-representing-objects) below.

## `IFS=$'\n'`

To load an array with items separated by newlines:

#### Example

```sh
# Create an array
declare -a items=()

# Run 'ls' and put each result into ar array
IFS=$'\n' read -d '' -ra items < <(ls)

# Read each line of a file into an array
IFS=$'\n' read -d '' -ra items < myFile
```

Alternatively, you may want a string separated by a character such as `:`

#### Example

```sh
# Create an array
declare -a items=()

# :-delimited string
textItems="foo:hello world:bar"

# Read the items into an array
IFS=: read -d '' -ra items < <(printf "$textItems")

echo "${#items[@]}"
# => 3

echo "${items[*]}"
# => "foo hello world bar"

# Or read a literal string in directly
IFS=: read -d '' -ra items <<< <(printf "foo:hello world:bar")

# ‚òùÔ∏è Gotcha: if you do this, there will be a trailing newline in the 'bar\n' item
IFS=: read -d '' -ra items <<< "foo:hello world:bar"
```

## `find -print0`

Related to `IFS`, to load an array with items from the `find` command:

#### Example

```sh
# Create an array
declare -a items=()

local filePath
while IFS= read -rd '' filePath
do
  items+=("$filePath")
done < <(find . -name "*.sh" -print0)
```

## `declare -A`

I have nothing to say about Bash Associative Arrays ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I almost never use them because I try to natively support Bash `3.2.57`.

<br>

# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Functions

## `local`

It is so super critical that every variable you assign in a function be `local`.

#### Example

```sh
myFunction() {
  local varOne # <-- ‚úÖ ALWAYS define variables as local
  varTwo=2     # <-- ‚ùå NEVER set globals unless you intend to
  declare -a varThree=() # declare defines vars as 'local' by default
}
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è When perfoming `for` loops, the variable name will become assigned.
> This will be global unless you define it as `local` before your `for` loop.
>
> ```sh
> myFunction() {
>   local arg # <-- define your 'for' loop variables as local
>   for arg in "$@"
>   do
>     : # do something
>   done
> }
>
> myFunction "hello" "world"
> echo "$arg"
> # => "" # <-- if you don't use `local arg`, this will be "world"
> ```

## `return`

Bash uses implicit returns, meaning the return code will be the `$?` return code of the last command run in your function - unless you explicitly `return`.

Recommend you check for error cases, e.g. wrong number of arguments or invalid arguments, and explicitly `return 1`.

Do not explicitly `return 0` unless you are sure the previous commands did not fail (_or if you do not care_).

#### Example

```sh
## # `myFunction`
##
## |      | Parameters |
## |------|------------|
## | `$1` | The one and only argument this function expects |
##
myFunction() {
  [ $# -ne 0 ] && { echo "Wrong number of arguments" >&2; return 1; }
  # do things
}
```

> üí° **Tip:** Always write tests for the return values of your functions.

## `declare -f`

If you need to view the source code of a function: `declare -f functionName`

> üí° **Tip:** If you need to copy a function, you can get the source code from `declare -f functionName`,
> replace the name at the start of the source code, and `eval` the source code.

# üçè Mac support

üí° **Recommendation:** Support Mac out-of-the-box, do not use newer Bash features.

> Many users of Bash use Mac and the easiest solution to supporting them is to author
> your Bash code to support `3.2.57` out of the box.
>
> (Optional) If so desired, create a branch of your code which branches on `$Bash_VERSION` and
> uses an alternate, optimized version of your program which supports more modern
> Bash features such as associative arrays and indirect variable references.
>
> See these alternate solutions to Bash 4.3+ features:
>
> - [Indirect Variable References](#typeset--n)
> - [Associative Arrays](#declare--a-1)

## `3.2.57(1)-release`

Mac ships with a version of Bash which was [released in 2002](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)#Release_history>): Bash 3.2.57(1)-release.

**Why?**

This is the last version of Bash which was shipped under the [GPLv2][] license, future versions switched to [GPLv3][].

[gplv2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Version_2
[gplv3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Version_3

Apple decided to stick with the [GPLv2][] version, even though it is 15 years old at the time of writing.

## `zsh`

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Starting with macOS Catalina, Macs now use [`zsh`][] as the default shell.
>
> _This document is not relevant to other shells, e.g. `zsh`_

[`zsh`]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell

## `BASH 4` + `BASH 5`

Bash 4 and 5 added useful features for developers and script authors, e.g.

- Associative Arrays (_string key/value pairs_)
- Indirect Variable References (_reference a variable using a dynamic variable name_)

If you want your Bash script to support Mac, you will not be able to use these features.

## `$variableName`

If your Bash scripts use variables with dynamic names, you will need to use `eval`.

In Bash 4.3 (_unsupported on Mac_), you can use `typeset -n` to get an indirect reference
to a variable by name and modify that variable.

```sh
hello="World"

# Modify the value of hello using a variable which contains the variable name "hello"
variableName=hello
typeset -n theVariable="$variableName"

echo "$theVariable"
# => "World"

theVariable="change me"

echo "$theVariable"
# => "change me"

echo "$hello"
# => "change me"
```

Bash 3.2.57 required `eval` to work with variables with dynamic names.

```sh
hello="World"

# Modify the value of hello using a variable which contains the variable name "hello"
variableName=hello
eval "$variableName=\"change me\""

echo "$hello"
# => "change me"
```

## `Docker`

If you are not developing on a Mac, it is recommended that you test your
application against Mac's `3.2.57` version of Bash using Docker and/or
configure your cloud test provider to run your tests on a Mac device.

### Example

Create a `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM bash:3.2.57
```

Build the image:

```sh
docker build -t bash3257 .
# Sending build context to Docker daemon  972.3kB
# Step 1/1 : FROM bash:3.2.57
#  ---> 4d4010b2347d
# Successfully built 4d4010b2347d
# Successfully tagged bash3257:latest
```

Run a Bash script in the local folder by mounting the folder and running it in a container via `bash`:

```sh
# [foo.sh]
echo "hi from $Bash_VERSION"
```

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD:/scripts" bash3257 bash scripts/foo.sh
# hi from 3.2.57(1)-release
```
