## ‚å®Ô∏è Variables

### `MYAPP_PUBLIC_VARIABLE`

Name public global variables in `UPPERCASE`

In general, **prefix** your global variable with something to identify to your users that the variable is associated with your script or program, e.g. `MYAPP_CONFIG_FILE`. This helps to avoid global naming collisions with variables in other libraries which your users may be using.

### `__myApp__privateVar`

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è All private variables should be `local` variables inside functions ([see more](#local))

Local and non-public variables should be named in `camelCase`  
(_although `snake_case` is more popular_)

In general, **prefix** your private variables to avoid naming collisions with variables in other libraries which your users may be using.

> üí° Reminder: variables you assign (_including locals_) will be available to the scope of other functions that you call.

#### ‚ùå Don't do this

```sh
myFunction() {
  local count=5 # Set a local variable (unrelated to function called below)
  calculate totals # Call the 'calculate' function
  echo "The count is $count and the total is $TOTAL" # Print local variable
}

# ---------------------------
# Function in another library:
calculate() {
  echo "You called calculate. The 'count' is $count"

  # This other library is using the 'count' variable and they
  # forgot to add 'local' or, in their library, 'count' is global.
  #
  # Modifications made to this variable will modify the parent
  # function's local 'count' variable.
  count=0

  local item
  for item in "CALCULATION_TOTALS[@]"
  do
    : $(( count++ ))
  done
  TOTAL="$count"
}
CALCULATION_TOTALS=(42)
```

```sh
$ myFunction
# You called calculate. The 'count' is 5
# The count is 1 and the total is 1
```

The final printed count should be 5, but it is 1 due to a naming collision.  
Even though your variable is a `local`!

## üçè Mac support

üí° **Recommendation:** Support Mac out-of-the-box, do not use newer BASH features.

> Many users of BASH use Mac and the easiest solution to supporting them is to author
> your BASH code to support `3.2.57` out of the box.
>
> (Optional) If so desired, create a branch of your code which branches on `$BASH_VERSION` and
> uses an alternate, optimized version of your program which supports more modern
> BASH features such as associative arrays and indirect variable references.
>
> See these alternate solutions to BASH 4.3+ features:
>
> - [Indirect Variable References](#typeset--n)
> - [Associative Arrays](#declare--a-1)

### `3.2.57(1)-release`

Mac ships with a version of BASH which was [released in 2002](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)#Release_history>): BASH 3.2.57(1)-release.

**Why?**

This is the last version of BASH which was shipped under the [GPLv2][] license, future versions switched to [GPLv3][].

[gplv2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Version_2
[gplv3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Version_3

Apple decided to stick with the [GPLv2][] version, even though it is 15 years old at the time of writing.

### `zsh`

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Starting with macOS Catalina, Macs now use [`zsh`][] as the default shell.
>
> _This document is not relevant to other shells, e.g. `zsh`_

### `BASH 4` + `BASH 5`

BASH 4 and 5 added useful features for developers and script authors, e.g.

- Associative Arrays (_string key/value pairs_)
- Indirect Variable References (_reference a variable using a dynamic variable name_)

If you want your BASH script to support Mac, you will not be able to use these features.

### `$variableName`

If your BASH scripts use variables with dynamic names, you will need to use `eval`.

In BASH 4.3 (_unsupported on Mac_), you can use `typeset -n` to get an indirect reference
to a variable by name and modify that variable.

```sh
hello="World"

# Modify the value of hello using a variable which contains the variable name "hello"
variableName=hello
typeset -n theVariable="$variableName"

echo "$theVariable"
# => "World"

theVariable="change me"

echo "$theVariable"
# => "change me"

echo "$hello"
# => "change me"
```

BASH 3.2.57 required `eval` to work with variables with dynamic names.

```sh
hello="World"

# Modify the value of hello using a variable which contains the variable name "hello"
variableName=hello
eval "$variableName=\"change me\""

echo "$hello"
# => "change me"
```

### `Docker`

If you are not developing on a Mac, it is recommended that you test your
application against Mac's `3.2.57` version of BASH using Docker and/or
configure your cloud test provider to run your tests on a Mac device.

#### Example

Create a `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM bash:3.2.57
```

Build the image:

```sh
docker build -t bash3257 .
# Sending build context to Docker daemon  972.3kB
# Step 1/1 : FROM bash:3.2.57
#  ---> 4d4010b2347d
# Successfully built 4d4010b2347d
# Successfully tagged bash3257:latest
```

Run a BASH script in the local folder by mounting the folder and running it in a container via `bash`:

```sh
# [foo.sh]
echo "hi from $BASH_VERSION"
```

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD:/scripts" bash3257 bash scripts/foo.sh
# hi from 3.2.57(1)-release
```
